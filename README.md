Literally just some halfassed HTML/CSS :)

Some *actually* halfassed HTML/CSS written to create a basic portfolio for MEJO 121 at UNC-Chapel Hill. Some stuff to consider before you use this:
1. Please don't plagiarize because UNC Honor Code be harsh af and I wouldn't wish the kind of pain they inflict on cheaters on anybody. 
2. Don't stalk me bcuz that's hella weird. 
3. I am not a CS major so shockingly this code is not super advanced or super amazing. 
4. If you see my personal info somewhere, reach out so I can remooooOOOOOOOve it.

Thanks & Peace
